Type R - The “R” stands for Racing.The Type R brand delivers speed and excitement that stimulates the driver and enhances the driving experience. All Type R cars are immersed in Honda’s racing DNA and the knowledge and expertise of Honda’s engineers. When creating a Type R car, Honda aim to create the ultimate driving machine.The spirit of Type R was first seen in 1964, long before the first Type R model was built. This was the year that Honda first joined Formula One. At the time Honda was still a relatively small car manufacturer but with the dedication of our engineers we met challenging targets and achieved what often seemed unachievable.The first Honda Formula One machine to compete in a Grand Prix (Germany) was painted in Ivory White and featured the Honda emblem in red…these colours have been passed on to all Honda Type R cars.
